# CS_210-Programming-Languages

•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
o	  This project combines C++ and Python in a single program to intake a text file, read it and then process data from it for a corner grocer program. 
    The program outputs data processed by passing the information to Python and then Python processes the data and returns a value to C++ to print out or great a histogram of. 

•	What did you do particularly well?
o 	Personally, I thought my understanding of the functionality of Python vs. C++ was great. I was able to pass the required parameters to the correct functions and 
    utilize the capabilities of both C++ and Python. When I needed to process Data, I passed the information from C++ to Python for data processing. 

•	Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
o	  There can always be enhancements, whether it be better graphical display for the user, or even more options put in the menu. I could also re organize my code,
    perhaps if needed I could implement classes into my code. It just depends on the needs and wants from the client as to what changes I would make. Obviously using
    reusable code is a great enhancement so that that preexisting code can easily be utilized. 

•	Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
o 	I found some of the for loops in Python a little difficult to write. I have two different types of loops that I used for this reason. I also had to learn that to display
    my list read from the text file in Python, to an item that was each printed on their own line, I had to change my list to a dictionary. This made the formatting easier 
    when writing to a file. I also found that using a zip to pass a single argument is necessary for one function but cannot be used in all the functions that I wrote.
 
•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
o	  My knowledge of how to combine two programming languages into a single buildable program was very useful. I had no idea this was even a possibility prior to taking this 
    course. But this course has allowed me to dive deeper into my understanding of both programming languages, and the intricate details in how they can enhance a program
    being used together. 

•	How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
o	  Maintainable and adaptable by creating functions and keeping my main with the least amount of code in it. Adaptable because I used reusable code that can be utilized 
    if the program changed or was built upon in the future.
